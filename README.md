The Lore I imagine is that the faction was "founded" by a group of scientists that survived the fallout in the arabian Desert with the help of a powerful AI they created.
They built robots, machines and a powerful reactor in cooperation with the AI.
There was only one problem: The scientists where too radiated to make kids or survive for very long, so they eventually died.
So the AI fully took over control and created synthetic humans.
Even though ot was powerful enough to create humans, this AI is still chained to the reactor core the scientists created to keep it alive and powered.
And because the synthetic humans cannot give birth itself, every human has to be bred manually in this faction
